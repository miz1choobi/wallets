The idea to create this repo came after [WalletUncon](https://walletuncon.org).
We need a way to discover/compare wallets - like protolambda mentioned in a reply to his rant about wallets - ["Who is building the L2Beat of web3 wallets?"](https://twitter.com/protolambda/status/1728829926697288020). 
This repository is intended to be the data-basis for this and an attempt to decouple data from usage.
Another goal is to push EIP6963 by praising wallets that support the EIP and shaming wallets that should support it
